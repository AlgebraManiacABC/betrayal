# betrayal
A version of Betrayal at House on the Hill (including Widow's Walk expansion) made for digital play

## Disclaimers:

This version is not affiliated with Avalon Hill, Hasbro,
or any other company involved with the creation of the original game.

Because this game uses protected assets, I cannot provide the executable files,
nor can I provide the assets I used to create them. However, if one were to
obtain the assets somehow, it wouldn't be too difficult to compile this game.
In case someone has the assets (like by taking pictures of a set obtained legally)
and wishes to compile the program, see the `assets.h` file for descriptions and
names of the assets I used. A template `assetlister.sh` script is provided for
creating a new `assets.h` from a list of files in `img/`.
